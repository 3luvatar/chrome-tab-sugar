h1. Tab Sugar - the Google Chrome extension

h2. Features

Tab Sugar eases the use of browser tabs when juggling with plenty of them. It acts for Chrome as "Tab Candy":http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/tabcandy/ does for Firefox.

h2. Download

You can "download Tab Sugar":https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/libokbfffpaopdjmeofdfpmlanaenaje on the official Google Chrome extension directory.

h2. Use

Tabs can be grouped, drag&dropped (into a group or an empty space), reordered within a group & closed
Groups can be named, dragged, resized & closed

h2. Status

It really is a Work in progress - Pre-alpha

I only see it as a Proof of Concept at the moment.
